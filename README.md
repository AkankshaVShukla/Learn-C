# Learn C++
C++ is a statically typed (type checking is performed during compile-time), compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming. </br>

C++ is regarded as a middle-level language. Comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.

#### Object-Oriented Programming
Encapsulation
Data hiding
Inheritance
Polymorphism
#### Compile and Run
'''
$ g++ hello.cpp
$ ./a.out
Hello World
'''
#### Identifiers
An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore (_) followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).
C++ does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. C++ is a case-sensitive programming language.

#### Primitive Built-in types
Type	          Keyword
Boolean	        bool
Character	      char (1 byte)
Integer	        int (int->4 bytes, short int -> 2 bytes, long int -> 4 bytes)
Floating point	float (4 bytes)
Double floating double (8 bytes)
Valueless	      void
Wide character	wchar_t (2 or 4 bytes)
